"Does history matter? There is an interesting discussion about what the BLM (Black Lives Matter) actually believes in regard to blacks and cops. Some would argue that this discussion really only comes down to who is killing the most people. If it were to come to light that more black men die by being shot by other black men, for some this would mean that BLM has no ground to stand on. But, there is another account of the ethics of BLM. They might be saying, in fact, that the history of terror between white and black people in America itself plays multiple roles in the situation. First, when a culture of terror exists over time between the same set of groups, there develops layers of experience, one might call it layers of darkness, which color every event. You not only have to deal with the terror or threats and bullet but also of the group on group relationship. This might increase the validity of the terror. Second, long historical tendencies themselves might also be intrinsically bad. So part of the ethical problem is not just now one person feels in one moment, but how groups feel over time. There are parallels here with terror between religious groups in the middle east, India, China, and anywhere that has ever had slavery.

"World humanism part 14
This is the ORIGINAL ideology of federated world community -backed up by a powerful philosophy- to KILL the Zionist plans of Globalism, New world order and one world government. And this is the only political ideology to resolve the irreconcilable CLASS ANTAGONISM.
Our PRINCIPLE philosophy is; 'in order to change the society, you need to change the CULTURE of the society'.
cvi) Meanwhile: the Socialism within the frame work of Capitalism is nothing but a bunch of BUREAUCRATIC DICTATORSHIP... Unless the Socialism is a global socio economic system with planned world economy; it is just another OPPRESSIVE political system for the working masses; no matter what nation state applies it...
Which is evident in the cases of China, Cuba and all those socialist labelled -counterrevolutionary- 'Nationalist' regimes.
That shouldn't mean I agree with Karl Marx's Socialism projection; where the working class is 'dictator' over the society under the dictation of a bunch of Marxist PARASITIC minority bureaucrats; and where the Democratic principles lifted to the shelves...
In our Humanist socio economic system there is no dictatorial authority, and the high contributing individuals are rewarded by handsome incentives, instead of being fearful of dictations.
Social Evolution is ESSENTIAL to ACHIEVE the Social Revolution.
1. It is the course of social EVOLUTION. Which will proceed naturally and decided by the socio-economic DY-NAMICS.
2. But if you are SKEPTIC not to know the laws of CAUSE and EFFECT; there is no cure for you.
3. It is NOT an impossible dream. Just a matter of UNI-FICATION of the co-thinkers of the world around a VIA-BLE political perspective.
4. But remember the socio-political fact that the Revolutions are the end results of Social Evolution.
5. And it cannot be achieved through the struggles of disoriented minorities, but through the UNIFIED efforts of dissatisfied majorities.
6. Social Evolution is ESSEN-TIAL to ACHIEVE the Social Revolution.11
7. Also bear in mind; today's traditional LEFT forces,-Marxist Trotskyist crowds- consist of parasitic EDUCAT-ED IGNORANT.
8. The first aspect every class conscious and progressive person to understand is; the SOCIALSIM/HUMANISM is the ALTERNATIVE world system to the Capitalism. Not the Nationalist factions like China or Cuba -and the rest- within the Capitalist order.
9. The DIFFERENCE is control-ling the world Economic system; by the minority Rich, or democratically elected community councils...
10. Which is to say; the productive forces of the world governed by the democratically elected Workplace, Community and Student councils.
11. And there can be no National solution to resolve CLASS AN-TAGONISM>
12. Which is to say that the PROGRESSIVE forces of the world community have the greatest RESPONSIBILTY to train and educate their social contacts politically.
13. No more Jaguera style individual HEROISM.
14 No more BUREAUCRACY dictatorships over the workers’ class struggle around the world.
15. Noooo more ‘once a leader is always a leader’ business within the Humanist organizations.
16. Instead, every RESPONSIBLE class conscious minded person should do his/her best to find a SOLUTION for facilitating the communities to train one another politically…
17. As we have proposed in the perspective of the Humanist International: A leader or member of the Humanist organization can only stand One or Maximum of 2 terms in his/her political party post… In order to regularly dynamize the political structure and prevent opportunism as well as corruption…
18. If you are TRULY a GENUINE progressive REVOLUTIONARY minded person, join the RANKS of Humanist International by joining the progressive elements in your locality to start CULTURAL GROUP DISCUSSIONS....
19. Our Revolutionary Ideology is LEGITIIMISED by the fact that, we are defending the interests of greatest majority of the world community...
20. Remember: The present world affairs are in the hands of LUNATIC financial OLIGARCH; their cultural RETARD political servants and confused duck world scientists; who are taking advantage of theeeeee political IGNORANCE of the world masses...
21. The majority of the world's youth today regard ""the politics is dirty business for politicians”...
What a PITY though: LIFE isn't long enough to repeat STUPIDITIES'...
22. Especially in this epoch of MASS unemployment, unbearable POVERTY and the WAR THREATS the Capitalism is dragging the mankind to medieval slave trade conditions by conditioning us to the excessive poverty.... ... ...
23. The raw materials -class conscious youth and workers- of the Revolution are out there at every level of society. It's just that not many progressive forces are available to train and motivate them politically...
24. And that is for the simple reason that, the pre-sent generation is grown up during the Prospering years of Capitalism assimilated them to the middle-class ideology...",2293516327472726,https://facebook.com/groups/Ethpolsocpsy/posts/2293516327472726,2022-04-28 22:43:41

"Founder’s Welcome Message
*******************************
Started with less than 30 members, and with the contribution of our good members, our membership today reaches 356, 000!

They say that philosophy is dead and obsolete. I think otherwise, for philosophy comes from the wisdom accumulated by people living their lives earnestly - navigating the ups and downs, twists and turns of life create philosophers among us - trials sharpen intelligence as tribulations beget wisdom! So, remember this, our experience in life, and with it our solutions for living life better, is our philosophy.

Also, some people argued and disagree with us, that our forum doesn't permit atheists vs theists debate; we believe it is pointless as it will always lead to heated up arguments and fights, disturbing the peace and tranquility of our learning atmosphere. Years have gone by, and through secular and experiential philosophy, we saw people agree more than they disagree. Why? Because they are standing on a common-ground - and the common-ground is the humanity in us. As human beings we are empathic and sympathetic toward others and are curious of new knowledge & culture, this bonds people and has nurtured our small forum community since. I believe many of you started off as strangers but are now good friends! 🙂

We are now one of the fastest growing forums on Facebook, and we intent to keep it progressing. To do that we have to keep up with the quality of our posts, and more importantly, we ask for the understanding of our members to check their topics before they post it on the forum. Recently, we spotted a few out of theme posts that contradicted the forum's direction.

For now, the future appears bright, but the journey is on. The way I see it, our forum has the potential to become one of the best knowledge-based forum on Facebook. In my opinion we should not be contented and must move forward to progress.

I am providing the guidelines again with this notice. Please see below.

With this, our team, thank you all for your warm support and participation. Thank you.

Forum's Etiquettes:

So, what constitute a great forum?
********************************************
1) great topics for discussion ( I will encourage contributors to be precise with their op and make sure its meme and content tally with the post).
2) responsive Op host - when you decide to post, please be prepared to take charge of your post and reply to others' queries. Unlike a notice board where you just paste the notice and leave the place.
3) maintain one's composure - be polite and respectful of others. And be humorous if you can. Ours is more of a discussion group and not an actual debate venue. So, don't be overly argumentative.
4) do not post off topic. This is a philosophy and general wisdom forum, hence do not post pop- culture stuffs or materials with strong religious or political implications. And do not post pictures of your grand meals or excessive favorite cartoon characters !
5) be creative but not bizarre...use your imagination for your next topic to post.
6) make new friends and exchange greetings to nurture good feelings (you wanna to come back to a place that is welcoming and warm).
7) stand your rights but do not be quarrelsome.
8)provide suggestions of improvement to the admin and moderators .
9) never troll and report all trolls to the moderators
10) please follow the rules. If you can't please exit the forum peacefully.

We believe with this 10 basic points in mind we are good to move forward with progression and rewards. Once again we thank you all for your great support and will do our best to make this forum interesting and safe for all!

Hip hip hooray!!!!

For new members who are not familiar with our house rules, please refer to the pinned post.

(Regarding trolling)
A troll is a member who:

1) start with rude or sarcastic remarks on OP without substantiating his reason for such vile remarks.

2) start debating unrelated to the topic of the Op.

3) instead of refuting the opponents or conversationists, a troll resort to personal attacks with repeated names calling and insults of profanity.

4)When advised by the Op host and members of the group who bare witness to the event, the troll will not stop and might increase his intensity of mockery.

This four basic points are the characteristics of a typical troll. The unique ones will be at the judgement of the admin.

People, if you see a troll please report to make this discussion group conducive.

Please note that this is a discussion group and not a actual debate group. Debate arises out of necessity to defend an important point , but respect and moderation are observed at all time.",2275787515831370,https://facebook.com/groups/799987083411428/posts/2275787515831370,2019-07-01 14:06:27

"Nurture is an extension of Nature
Many think that nature and nurture are different or opposite from each other. However, if we investigate carefully, we will find that nurture is an extension of nature. They are the two sides of the one movement of life and are mutually interdependent.
For example - Healing is a natural property of the body, but the… More human mind discovered the system of medicine and antibiotics, which complemented the body’s ability to heal. Likewise, nature gave us eyes to see. But the mind invented the microscope, a telescope, and television through which our eyes can see small objects, objects far away, and watch the events happening elsewhere.
Mind is formed through the brain and the body and brain, and the body is part of nature. Therefore, the mind, the nurture, is an extension of nature.",5037177856358975,https://facebook.com/groups/799987083411428/posts/5037177856358975,2022-04-30 09:38:31

"Why differences?
The exaltation of race, people, state or a particular form of religion or denomination is the main cause of division resulting into chaos. People are constantly in competition with one another and this bring conflicts.
When religions begin exchanging differences and one exalts his religion, the reaction is predictably negative.

Think a little bit about the causes of persecution in the middle age. It was all about religions particularly Christianity against herself due to division as I talked about it previously.

Even the minute denominations are beginning to divide into fragments. When the rope begins to be pulled in the church know that persecution isn't far away. Christians have ever done some weird things against themselves due to difference in just opinions.",5035212349888859,https://facebook.com/groups/799987083411428/posts/5035212349888859,2022-04-29 15:13:59

"Critical Thinking for Life Not Work
Witches are burned, wars are fought, and society is damaged by a lack of critical thinking. Not at work but in the home. People keep believing what the most persuasive source tells them, where what is persuasive is determined by cognitive biases and blind spots.
The conventional concept of critical thinking (CT), indeed the earliest definition of the term, is that it consists of three interconnecting elements: knowledge (such as a logical system), skill (applying that logical system to construct and analyze arguments) and disposition (dedication to critical-thinking principles, rather applying biased beliefs, or simply adoption of what some “authority” says us true).
Tim-van-Gelder argues that becoming a skilled critical thinker takes as much effort as becoming highly skilled athlete or musician: approximately 10,000 hours. This is way too hard for the average person, so how can we achieve the best result for the least effort?
My suggestion? Reverse psychology. Set people the following challenge; “Your task is to make people believe that most birds are actually small robots spying on people. What techniques would you use?”
My reasoning is that each person will attempt to solve the challenge by using their own life experiences and mental capacities. Thus their answers are meaningful to them. The hope is that in developing the answers they will become more aware of their cognitive biases and blind spots and thus the need for caution/CT in accepting memes.
Do you have any other candidate solutions?

"""I think therefore I am"", famously concluded Descartes. But it begs the question. It asserts in the premise what should be asserted only in the conclusion.

Descartes introduces, “I think” as evidence that “I am”, but he fails to first derive the identity of this “I” from this “thinking”. This “I” that thinks is not necessarily derived from thinking. There is thinking. Yes. But whether or not this thinking can serve as necessary and sufficient evidence for the existence of a substantial “I”, is a completely different question. Descartes mistakenly makes a necessary connection between appearances and a substance behind them. “Thinking” does not necessarily lead to a “thinker”.

Descartes deduces identity from qualities without thinking the qualities may very well subsist on their own. Perhaps appearances do not have a substance behind them. Descartes is just building one out of thinking, but phenomena could stay as such without a foundation.

Naturally, if there is an “I”who thinks there must be an “I” who is, but the “I” who thinks has yet to be proven to exist. Descartes is arbitrarily attaching an “I” to the thinking. Descartes is counting his chickens before his eggs.

"Mind of Time.
Neuroscientists have been unable to locate a single clock in the brain that is responsible for detecting time passing. The human perspective of time may not be exclusively biological, but rather shaped by our culture and era. However much time feels like time is something that flows in one direction, some scientists beg to differ that time is not always segmented neatly into the past, the present and the future. Events don’t happen in a set order and some physical equations work in either direction. A few theoretical physicists speculate that time neither flows, nor even exists. It is an illusion.

Most of us would say that how time functions is fairly obvious: it passes, at a consistent and measurable rate, in a specific direction – from past to future. This is why the evidence from physics is at odds with how life feels. Our shared idea of what the concept of “future” or “past” mean may not apply to everything everywhere in the Universe, but it does reflect the reality of our lives here on Earth.

Psychologists have demonstrated that autobiographical memory is not like that at all. Most of us forget far more than we remember, sometimes forgetting events happened at all, despite others’ insistence that we were there. On occasion even the reminder does nothing to jog our memories.

As we lay down memories, we alter them to make sense of what’s happened. Every time we recall a memory, we reconstruct the events in our mind and even change them to fit in with any new information. Another mistake we make is to assume that imagining the future is completely different from thinking about the past. In fact, the two processes are linked. We recruit similar parts of the brain to reminisce or to picture our lives in years to come. It is the possession of our memories that permits us to imagine a future, remixing scenes to preview future events in a window in the mind. This skill allows us to make plans and to try out different hypothetical possibilities before we commit.These curious sensations occur as a result of the way our brains deal with time.

A baby, with little by way of autobiographical memory, lives constantly in the present. She’s happy. She’s crying. She’s hungry. She’s miserable. A baby experiences all this, but doesn’t think back to how cold it was last month or worry that temperature might drop again soon. Then gradually a toddler will begin to develop a sense of self. With that development comes an understanding of time, of yesterday as distinct from tomorrow. Even at that age, though, imagining one’s self in the future remains a challenge.

Psychologist found that if you ask three-year-olds what they might do the following day, only a third can give an answer judged to be plausible. When the psychologist gave small children some pretzels to eat followed by the option of more pretzels or some water, it won’t surprise you to learn that, thirsty after eating the salt, most chose water. But when she asked them what they would like to have when they came back the next day, most still opted for water. (Adults chose pretzels, knowing that by tomorrow they will feel hungry again.) Very small children are unable to imagine themselves in a future where they might feel differently than they do in this moment.

The experience of time is actively created by our minds. Various factors are crucial to this construction of the perception of time – memory, concentration, emotion and the sense we have that time is somehow located in space. Our time perception roots us in our mental reality. Time is not only at the heart of the way we organise life, but the way we experience it. Instead of considering the past, present and future to be in a straight line, we can look on our memories as a resource to allow us to think of the future.

This is crucial. Humans’ ability to time travel mentally, forward and back, is why we’re able to do so many of the things that set us apart – such as plan for the future or create a work of art. And the important role that memory has to play within that isn’t a new idea: Aristotle, for example, described memories not as archives of our lives, but as tools for imagining the future.

Your memory is so flexible that in an instant you can summon up your personally-recorded memories of the street where you work, the faces of your school friends, images of tropical flowers and cocktails. You not only locate all these memories which might be decades apart, but you then splice them together to invent a scene you have never witnessed or even heard of before.

So we shouldn’t curse our memories when they let us down. They’re made to be changeable, in order that we can take millions of fragments of memories from different times of our lives and recombine them to give us endless imaginative possibilities for the future. Instead of thinking of our memories as a handy archive, we can bear in mind that our memory of an event might not be perfect – and accept that others might have very different memories of the same event.

In middle age, the weeks and the years can feel as though they flash by. But part of our sense of time passing is dictated by the number of new memories we have made. When you look back on a busy holiday, even though it went quickly at the time, in retrospect it can feel as though you were away for ages. This is because of all those new memories you made by spending a week outside your usual routine. If life feels as though it’s going fast, this could be a sign of a life that is full.

Meanwhile, time does feel as though it’s going more slowly if you are bored or depressed or feeling lonely or feeling rejected. As Pliny the Younger wrote, “The happier the time, the shorter it seems.” All this fun means the time will fly in the moment – but because you will lay down more memories, when you get to Monday morning, the weekend will have felt long.The more memories you can create for yourself in everyday life, the longer your life will feel when you look back.

The way we experience time in our minds is never going to match up with the latest discoveries in physics. We all know what the passing of time feels like. Although we can’t change the way our brains perceive time, there are better ways we can start to think about it. But even then, the way it warps in certain situations will continue to surprise and unsettle us. In the end, perhaps, St Augustine put it best when he asked: “What then is time? If no one asks me, then I know. If I wish to explain it to someone who asks, I know it not.”",3216815265196972,https://facebook.com/groups/1574445816100600/posts/3216815265196972,2022-04-21 21:34:13

"“Our 'natural' reaction will be to divide mankind into friend and foe; into those who belong to our tribe, to our emotional community, and those who stand outside it; into believers and unbelievers; into compatriots and aliens; into class comrades and class enemies; and into leaders and led.
I have mentioned before that the theory that our thoughts and opinions are dependent upon our class situation, or upon our national interests, must lead to irrationalism. I now wish to emphasize the fact that the opposite is also true. The abandonment of the rationalist attitude, of the respect for reason and argument and the other fellow's point of view, the stress upon the 'deeper' layers of human nature, all this must lead to the view that thought is merely a somewhat superficial manifestation of what lies within these irrational depths. It must nearly always, I believe, produce an attitude which considers the person of the thinker instead of his thought. It must produce the belief that 'we think with our blood', or 'with our national heritage', or with our class'. This view may be presented in a materialist form or in a highly spiritual fashion; the idea that we 'think with our race' may perhaps be replaced by the idea of elect or inspired souls who 'think by God's grace'. I refuse, on moral grounds, to be impressed by these differences; for the decisive similarity between all these intellectually immodest views is that they do not judge a thought on its own merits. By thus abandoning reason, they split mankind into friends and foes; into the few who share in reason with the gods, and the many who don't (as Plato says); into the few who stand near and the many who stand far; into those who speak the untranslatable language of our own emotions and passions and those whose tongue is not our tongue. Once we have done this, political equalitarianism becomes practically impossible.
Now the adoption of an anti-equalitarian attitude in political life, i.e. in the field of problems concerned with the power of man over man, is just what I should call criminal. For it offers a justification of the attitude that different categories of people have different rights; that the master has the right to enslave the slave; that some men have the right to use others as their tools. Ultimately, it will be used, as in Plato, to justify murder.”

"Empathy and compassion for one's fellow human beings should always remain at the top of one's morality list...everything ""good"" naturally flows from those two human emotions...
Secular Humanism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself. - Gelatins 5:12
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you--who are you to judge your neighbor? - James 4:12
These two verses were all the Christian god needed to say to its followers as far as the subject of morality goes...clear, concise, and to the point...
The rest of the bible is completely superfluous as far morality is concerned...and all the other scriptural passages about the subject only serve to complicate the issue by introducing all sorts of moral ambiguities, inconsistencies, and contradictions...
If only these two passages were included it would have saved humankind millennia worth of misery, innocent suffering, and death...
Empathy and compassion for my fellow humans drive my own secular morality...and it's all I ever needed as far as a personal moral construct...
I often question my sense of morality...but as long as empathy and compassion remain at the top of my list of moral values, I'm fine...but if they slip to a lower position...that's my cue to re-evaluate my behavior...
In my case, no other form of ""Ultimate Moral Authority"" was needed...",4870702559719897,https://facebook.com/groups/SPFH2/posts/4870702559719897,2022-04-30 12:56:25
"I have many religious friends and family in ""real life"" and they encompass a panoply of religious and philosophical views and beliefs...and I am always happy to engage them in civil discourse...sometimes these are ""long-distance"" relationships...

A letter to a Christian friend: God and the Universe.

As per our last discussion with regards to whether or not some kind of god is responsible for creating our universe or not...I'm perfectly comfortable admitting that I don't know...and strongly feel it's the most logical position for me to take...

Neither you nor I, nor can ANY human being claim with any absolute certainty how or why our universe exists...and to claim differently seems the height of human presumptuousness and hubris...but just because science doesn't have all the answers that doesn't necessarily mean that ""god did it.""

There was a time in human history when virtually NOTHING scientific was known about the universe...because of this ignorance, humans attributed everything unknown about it to one god or another...

I feel strongly that to be satisfied with ""god did it"" as an answer to such important existential unknowns is the antithesis of truth and knowledge...because you are making empirical claims without supporting them with objective, falsifiable evidence...only philosophical ones, which can be refuted with contrasting philosophies...(Teleological refute, Ontological refute, Appeal to Authority refute, etc.)

I’m an atheist, not a philosopher...so, it is for far greater minds than mine to argue such complexities...but again, I feel rather strongly that a god can't be definitively proven to exist using just philosophy...and even if one could...it still wouldn't necessarily be your Christian God-concept...I think if a god is ever proven to truly exist it's probably going to be something beyond our current ability to conceive...

Comparatively speaking, we know so little about the universe...and in many ways, humans are ""ignoramuses"" when it comes to cosmology...but mathematicians, astrophysicists, astronomers et al seem to have made tremendous strides toward finding the answers to the origins of our universe...and in such a relatively short period of human history...

But again, I’m an atheist, not a cosmologist, so I can’t speak with any authority on the subject...why do you think you can?

However, scientific explanations about our universe are far more likely to be true than believing that some invisible, mute supernatural being with ""magical"" powers created everything...

And IMHO, ANY scientific explanation for ANYTHING is more likely to be true than a supernatural one...

This is because nothing in the history of human civilization has ever been empirically verified as having a supernatural etiology...but I also can see no valid reason to jump to any solid conclusions either way about the possible existence of a supernatural being, or force...or whatever its attributes may be...but if objective, empirical data is ever presented to the contrary, I'd have no problem at all reconsidering my views about the subject...

If humanity had ever been satisfied with “god did it” as an explanation for everything and anything we didn’t understand, we’d still be living in caves...or possibly have gone extinct...

So, invoking “god did it” every time humans don’t understand something places a period at the end of a sentence that science is still writing...

You and I will most likely never live to see a definitive answer to such complex questions...but if we take your approach, and get comfortable with the notion of ""god did it"" the human race may never even get the CHANCE to try and find out what the objective truth is about such matters...

Furthermore, it's been my experience when dealing with theist-based ontologies and epistemologies is that they don't like uncertainty...so, they look for simple answers to complex questions...and they need DEFINITIVE answers for everything...and if they can't get them through science they fall back on the ""god of the gaps"" philosophy to fill in what their belief system is lacking...and I just think that's intellectually unsound and philosophically disingenuous...and I also happen to think the same thing about those atheists who make definitive claims about the NON-existence of gods...we don't even know what we don't know at this point in human history...so, it will be up to future scientists, philosophers, and theologians to discover the truth about such cosmological and existential questions...

Using secular humanism as a basis for my morality, I've lead a mostly happy and productive life filled with empathy and compassion for my fellow human beings and see absolutely no reason to change my epistemological choices at this point unless some major scientific or theological discoveries are made that would lead me to do so...

Therefore, I remain quite secure and yes, humble, in my agnostic atheism...and feel it's the most intellectually honest position for me to personally take...at least until some legitimate, empirical evidence can definitively prove that ANY kind of god actually exists...let alone your rather specific version of one…

I look forward to your reply, my fidus Achates

Bob",4868232203300266,https://facebook.com/groups/SPFH2/posts/4868232203300266,2022-04-29 15:19:37

Book cover in comments

Article:

The World Congress Of Families would be well served to direct the above question at themselves.

The WCF, founded in 1997, is an international consortium of conservative and fundamentalist groups dedicated to fostering the “pro-family” agenda worldwide. Their next summit was to be held in Moscow in September, as they have worked closely with anti-gay Russian leaders in their quest to spread their agenda throughout the world. The conference has been put on hold — officially, though we will not be surprised if the event suddenly is back on very soon — due to tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Penny Nance of Concerned Women For America, a World Congress-affiliated organization, broke from her movement by publicly pulling out of the event, part of which was to be held in the Kremlin. It was a surprising move, considering the fact that, though the WCF was founded by American organizations, the group has signalled strongly that they value their agenda far more than their own patriotism, as communications director Don Feder had once written that President Barack Obama was a stronger threat to the United States’ national security than Vladimir Putin is.

The World Congress of Families is linked to Russia’s controversial “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations to minors” law, which criminalizes coming out and has given free rein to neo-Nazi hooligans to attack Women, LGBT, and people of different ethnic heritage. Other major organizations involved in planning the Kremlin World Congress have included Focus On The Family, the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) and the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute (C-FAM). Two of those organizations, ADF and C-FAM, are listed as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Right Wing Watch provides more background on the WCF summit, and how deeply connected it is to the Russian government.

In an effort to understand the worldview that has led to American conservative organizations to sidle up to thugs and dictators around the world, choosing them over the duly elected leaders of our free, democratic society, I decided to start digging into the writings of the key players and founders involved in the World Congress of Families, starting with John A. Howard, a founder of the Howard Center For Family, Religion and Society in Rockford, Illinois, which founded the WCF. Detoxifying The Culture is a collection of Howard’s speeches and writings spanning over four decades, starting in the 1960’s, the decade when, in the eyes of Howard and others like him, everything went wrong.

To begin with, let me say that some of Howard’s motives and goals are virtuous. Throughout his writings, he emphasizes the qualities of service to others, of committing oneself to great causes, and working for the betterment of society. The problem, as readers will see, is that these ideals are expressed within the confines of a limited religious worldview that, without any corroborating evidence, sees itself as the only virtuous way to live. Indeed, what comes through in the course of the book is the idea that Howard believes in freedom, equality and love for everyone, as long as everyone is willing to live within the rigid boundaries of a conservative Christian worldview. Indeed, Howard seems to believe that his religious beliefs should be the guiding force in establishing laws for our secular society. (Though he would likely argue that our society was never meant to be secular in the first place. He would be wrong, but he would argue that.) This will be a running theme in examining Howard’s writings, and, I suspect, will continue as a theme as we research these people further.

Before examining some key passages from the book, I must point something out. Though Howard and others would be loath to admit it, they lost the 1960 - 1970's American culture battle. Their activities continue in America, abroad, in places like Russia, Africa, Jamaica and all points between, are a desperate attempt to find purchase for their beliefs somewhere, and to do that, they must slide in next to some of the world’s most unsavory despots and dictators and activists, and into nations with populations beset with poverty, disease, lack of economic opportunity and other maladies, for only in those places will the people take their discredited ideas seriously. Only in those places is there a populace prepared to believe that the greatest problem facing them is a chimerical population of imperialist Western gays secretly plotting the destruction of their cultures and their families. We can be grateful that most of the West is moving beyond such silly, antiquated ideas, but as citizens of the world, we must speak out for the peoples who are being convinced to scapegoat vulnerable minority populations by leaders who seek to absolve themselves of blame for the poor states of their societies, and we must speak out against the American conservative activists, like Howard and the WCF who are all too willing to provide them assistance.

Let’s start with Howard’s conception of the 1960’s. During this time, certain segments of the population, in the wake of the bloody quagmire of the Vietnam War, the tensions of the Cold War, horrific racial inequality, the continuing second class citizen status of women, and other issues, began to wake up. Though Howard pays convincing lip service to the noble cause of the Civil Rights Movement, he seems to believe America would have been better off if those segments of the population had just stayed asleep and continued to let fundamentalist Christian white men lead the culture:

“During the 1950′s, America was prosperous. It was the one powerful, respected nation of the world. By and large, the population was comfortable, happy and confident about the future. Things were going well for the United States. Even so, the children growing up in that period became increasingly uneasy about the possibility of atomic warfare. There were bomb shelters and school evacuation drills and there was much public distress about the Soviet Union’s spreading its Marxist doctrines across the globe. The East West tensions took on the ominous title of the Cold War.

“Another cause of distress was America’s failure to give a fair shake to its Black citizens, brought into sharp focus by the Civil Rights Movement and the cruel efforts to suppress it. In households like the Gitlins’ [Todd, author who wrote The Sixties, Years Of Hope, Days Of Rage] where the liberal parents had regularly voiced their sympathy for down-trodden peoples throughout the world, it was a natural thing for the chilren to rejoice when the repressive Batista regime of Cuba was overthrown by Fidel Castro and his band of revolutionaries. The humanitarian claims of socialism seemed a welcome contrast to the American reality.

“In addition to being troubled by the Bomb and America’s unfair treatment of the Blacks, the baby boom generation became increasingly worried as the Vietnam conflict expanded and the draft took a growing portion of the young men. Allegations that America was fighting an unjust war for the benefit of special interests were perhaps too readily accepted, without much thought about whether they were true. When it turned out that the ‘good guys’ who had freed the Cuban people from oppression were, in fact, Communists, that revelation, for many who were nervous about The Bomb, raised doubts about whether America should even be trying to contain Communism. Maybe America’s anti-Communist foreign policy was a bad idea rather than a good one.

howard“Further inciting the growing antagonism toward the government was the discrepancy between the 18-year-old draft age and the 21-year-old voting age. This was a foolish policy blunder that was skillfully exploited by radical leaders. Many college students came to look upon themselves as disenfranchised cannon fodder. They were old enough to fight and be killed in a war, but not old enough to have a say in their government. Before long, draft resistance and draft evasion came to be looked upon as heroic acts of integrity. Patriotism, in the old sense, was laughable, a thing of scorn.”

As movements against the war and racial inequality coalesced, another demon entered the picture, in Howard’s view: rock and roll music, and with it, marijuana. Though today marijuana is on the cusp of being legalized in various forms across the nation (and researchers continue to find that components of the drug can have effects ranging from pain relief to outright cures for an assortment of diseases and conditions), Howard remains in the Reefer Madness mindset. Though he says the right words about believing in freedom, an early clue that he and his cohort don’t believe in freedom at all can be found in his feelings.",4863971397059680,https://facebook.com/groups/SPFH2/posts/4863971397059680,2022-04-28 01:42:58

"""I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice...”

By which Einstein meant that quantum mechanics is incomplete or even wrong because it includes randomness.

Bohr famously replied, “Einstein, stop telling God what to do.""

https://medium.com/@gkalyan2000/stop-telling-god-what-to-do-e94ae5e8733b

Einstein was skeptical that Quantum Mechanics was the correct formulation of physics and was criticizing Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.

But of the two, Bohr turned out to be correct…

""Quantum mechanics explains how the universe works at a scale smaller than atoms. It is also called quantum physics or quantum theory. Mechanics is the part of physics that explains how things move and quantum is the Latin word for 'how much'. A quantum of energy is the least amount possible (or the least extra amount), and quantum mechanics describes how that energy moves or interacts.

Atoms used to be considered the smallest building blocks of matter, but modern science has shown that there are even smaller particles, like protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics describes how the particles that make up atoms work.

Quantum mechanics also tells us how electromagnetic waves (like light) work. Wave–particle duality means that particles behave like waves and waves behave like particles. (They are not two kinds of thing, they are something like both: this is their duality.) Much of modern physics and chemistry can be described and understood using the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics.

The mathematics used to study subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves is very complex because they act in very strange ways...""

"“I’m just trying to help you!”

This is probably one of the most harmful things we can say.

The above sentence is usually used when another declines whichever interpretation we would have of another. Be it how another thinks, or what another feels, or which experience another has.
It can just as easily be equivalent to harming another physically and telling them we’re doing that because we love them.

What lies behind this is protecting our own feelings, or emotions, not taking responsibility for that, and demanding another to cater us.

If and when we genuinely try to help another, the decision needs to be on them. If another declines our help, we need to respect their decision. This is not the system of “I’m just trying to help you”.
“I’m just trying to help you” places us into a victim position, garners pity for our position, and it’s only a manipulative tactic to convince another to let go, because we believe we have good intentions. It is also a one sided situation. Where the emotions, feelings, and thoughts are only relevant of the side of the so called helper. On top of that, it also eliminates the idea that our own interpretation of what is actually helpful for another could be incorrect.

‘Help’ is not about imposing our own ideas, desires, needs, beliefs, emotions, strategies, and so on, onto another.
‘Help’ is about eliminating the suffering of another. And what eliminates the suffering of another is determined by another, not by ourselves.
If we determine what eliminates it for another, it is imposing ourselves onto another.

“I’m only trying to help you” is essentially about our own suffering, and trying to eliminate our own suffering.",1328834677606320,https://facebook.com/groups/760505804439213/posts/1328834677606320,2022-04-28 05:32:35

"Happy birthday Ludwig Wittgenstein! For anyone coming from an analytic philosophy background, reading Wittgenstein was more like therapy than being subjected to a properly conducted ‘argument.’ Instead of ‘refuting’ (on their own terms) the analytic philosophers who were preoccupied with the traditional bugbears of philosophy, Wittgenstein’s (especially later) writings rather ‘cured’ one of the interest of continuing to pursue these traditional “problems” of philosophy, thereby allowing one to talk about and be interested in more interesting things than, for example, proving ‘with absolute certainty’ that one has hands, or any other absurdly obvious claim. In this way, reading Wittgenstein can be a liberating experience: not because his philosophy is one of liberation, per se, but because reading Wittgenstein can help to liberate one *from* philosophy—or, at least, what passes for philosophy in most English-speaking analytic departments.

In Symposium: A Philosophical Mash-up, Wittgenstein’s writings are responsible for a lot of the heavy lifting to help climb out of the hole that is caused by going along with the Cartesian project of radical doubt, once it hits its inevitable impasse in the vacuum of ‘pure epistemology.’ While the adherents of scepticism would rather persist forever in the shadows of metaphysical indecision, Wittgenstein’s blistering attack not only refuted but also ridiculed their approach. Along with his airtight arguments, his invective and jokes revealed the extent to which this type of philosophy was, in his eyes, not just wrong, but shameful and embarrassing too, hence more in need of rescue and salvation than mere correction. The format for Wittgenstein’s first book, based off an engineering manual, also inspired some of the more straightforward arguments from the book that do not take the form of a dialogue or poetic exposition, specifically in chapters 2, 9, and 10. Here, however, is a slice of Metaword from chapter 7 that deals with the aforementioned Cartesian quagmire: how can I be certain of anything?

http://zudoztylz.com/symposium/ch7/meta/

René Descartes: [I]f I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I just happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men themselves… Yet do I see any more than hats and coats which could conceal automatons? (“Meditations on First Philosophy”II, Selected Philosophical Writings)

Charles Sanders Peirce: Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts. (“Some Consequences of Four Incapacities”)

Ludwig Wittgenstein: Can I doubt it? Grounds for doubt are lacking! Everything speaks in its favour, nothing against it. (On Certainty §4)

G. E. Moore: I can prove now, for instance, that two human hands exist. How? By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a certain gesture with the right hand, ‘Here is one hand’, and adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, ‘and here is another’… And if such a thing as that could ever be certain, then assuredly it was certain just now that there was one hand in one of the two places I indicated and another in the other. (“Proof of an External World”)

Ludwig Wittgenstein: My having two hands is, in normal circumstances, as certain as anything that I could produce in evidence for it. (On Certainty §250)

Danièle Moyal-Sharrock: That is, according to Wittgenstein, Moore is not making any of the above assertions on the evidence of his senses. He did not, prior to his assertions, make sure that he was present in the room and not in the open air, that he had clothes on, that he was speaking and not singing. Moore may have looked as if he were making sure that he really was there; that is, he may have ostentatiously ‘looked’ at himself, pointed at himself, at his shirt, and so on. And in fact, he did ‘show’ his hand… But these are all mimicry of verification and justification; he did not look for his hand before showing it; there was no uncertainty there that would have required checking… That is, our certainty about some of the things we experience is not derived from our senses; indeed, it is not derived at all. (Understanding Wittgenstein’s On Certainty 6)

John Stuart Mill: There is no such thing as absolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life. We may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and pernicious. (On Liberty II)

Ludwig Wittgenstein: Now I would like to regard this certainty, not as something akin to hastiness or superficiality, but as a form of life… But that means I want to conceive it as something that lies beyond being justified or unjustified; as it were, as something animal. (On Certainty §358 – 359)

Gordon P. Baker & P. M. S. Hacker: Wittgenstein did indeed think that forms of life lie beyond justification, also that conceptual structures, world-pictures that are embodied in forms of life transcend justification. But does it follow that a form of life is something animal? Or is it something animal only in just that respect of transcending justification? (Wittgenstein: Rules, Grammar, Necessity: Volume II V)

Danièle Moyal-Sharrock: With the word ‘animal’, Wittgenstein does not mean to reduce these basic certainties to brute impressions. He is saying that these certainties are nonreflective, and they can be nonreflective either in that they are instinctual (or innate) certainties (such as ‘I have a body’), or in that they are, or have become, automatic (reflex-like) certainties (e.g. ‘This is (what we call) a hand’). Their being nonreflective or animal invites us to think of these certainties in nonpropositional terms. (“Introduction”, Understanding Wittgenstein’s On Certainty)

Stig Hjarvard: Having a non-propositional character means that these schema are not in themselves sufficient or substantial enough to form the basis for meaningful statements… Image schemata are basic metaphors that are projected onto a given subject matter. Therefore, they have a structuring effect and contribute to the production of a higher, true propositional meaning. (“Simulated Conversations.

"School of THOUGHT: 26.04.2022
Despite the fact that human brain is the highest developed organism in nature, ant-parallel to that fact it is the least understood mystery in universe. As far back as 2012 I have tried to express this fact with these factual compositions many, many times, but unfortunate enough my repetitions of facts didn’t change a thing in human behaviour. And also regardless of my repeated expressions in the philosophical book series of humanity Falsified the general outlook of the society is getting from worse to the worst. It seems to me ongoing natural, economic, political and social crises don’t seem to play as SHOCK TREATMENT in the attitudes of human society.
Here is how I had started the first volume of Humanity Falsified essay which went viral for years on the net and its rating hit the 4 star seo evaluations:
‘Let’s think for a moment; the mankind found the ways and means of advancing the industry, Science, Technology, Medicine, including profiteering and Religion: (THE latter 2 CONCEPTS ATTRACTED MORE ATTENTION THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN PRACTICE IN THE HISTORY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD> start thinking why?) And everything else historically, but didn’t and couldn’t find a way to advancing his own mind…
When it came to advancing its own very mind, the human attitude clashed to the barriers of money making and religious indoctrination like the sleepwalkers without even realizing the fact that, both concepts are created in the image of man himself’.
However, it’s not sufficient to say the human brain is a miraculous mystery, but let’s go into deep details to understand how our brains function.
We have 5 emotional senses at the services of our brain structure. Which is Vison, hearing smelling, touching, and feeling.
Our minds evaluate and analyse the information it receives from the practical experiences of those senses and stores the selected/worthy information into memory department after they are filtered through the inspection of subconscious department for use in future which becomes our mind CULTURE . The subconscious department never sleeps day and night to create our dreams and functions 24/7 basis for our personal safety measures, and the dreams she creates during our sleep are the concerns of our happiness, Hopes, difficulties, excitements, and anxieties and so on..
Our intellect is also developing through the experiences of those 5 senses; therefore, it is directly related to our cultural accumulations.
In this realm, ‘our mind psychology functions in accordance with the CULTURAL beliefs regardless of our Age. Gender, education, social status, or nationality.’
The other ‘critical’ reality to keep in mind is, despite being the highest developed organism in nature, -if not also within the universe- man’s mind is VULNRABLE to the traps of any FSALSE ideology and adjust itself to it at no time. The proof of evidence is, there are more than 5000 God conception the modern world population believe, and the numbers of religions and their sects are beyond count. e.g., Some believe there are over 41 000 Christian denominations who all believe different forms of Christianity… What does that prove to you? THINKKKK!!!…
At the end of all those facts, when man’s slave MONEY and the religion, which is the fruit of human imagination, become the master to dominate his mind, then the socio-economic balance collapses for good…",1327302491092872,https://facebook.com/groups/760505804439213/posts/1327302491092872,2022-04-25 19:57:10

We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

"We live our lives and we tend to think that there are things around us which are guaranteed. In his 3rd thought in Enchiridion Epictetus says that we need to prepare ourselves to lose things. In fact, not only objects but also human beings who are - as we think - necessary for our existence. Can you imagine world without your wife or children? Epictetus tells us that we have to analyze such situation and try to be prepared for the most difficult events in life. It will help us to embrace them.

"Hi!
We are switching to a new public group experience. Here are the things you need to know.

We’re making some changes to public groups to make them more open:

Public groups will be easier for people to discover, both on and off Facebook. A couple ways we’re doing this:
When someone shares a link or post on Facebook, their followers will have the option to see related discussions taking place in public groups.
Content from public groups will appear more often in search engine results off Facebook.
People can join public groups and get updates without admin approval. Keep in mind that admins still have control over who posts in the group, but anyone can join and read group content without needing approval.
Admins have the option to let anyone participate in their public groups, even if they aren't members of that group. Admins can decide who is allowed to post in the group: anyone, or just members of the group. Admins can also choose to approve all posts before they’re published.
Admins can let members post and comment using customizable profiles in groups. Members of the group can also change their member name. Keep in mind that admins, moderators and group members will continue to be able to see the authentic profiles and identities of members posting using member names.
Keep in mind:

Admins have the option to opt in to the new group experience. Once an admin decides to opt in, all admins have 72 hours to cancel. Once that time is over, the change is permanent.
If an admin blocked or muted someone, they'll still be blocked or muted if the group updates to the new public group experience.
When an existing public group is updated to a new public group, the group won't be able to create a Messenger Room, watch party or chats. This also means that any existing rooms or chats in the group won't be accessible.",2498317016978863,https://facebook.com/groups/philosophyoftruth/posts/2498317016978863,2021-03-11 11:09:58
"To Theist, Atheist and Agnostic:

When one realizes that God did not create the physical universe therefore God is not a part of the physical universe, not another member of the physical universe that can be examined objectively as all other members of the physical universe, one can see why God can never be the object of a scientific, empirical observation. God is not just another member in a continuous succession of finite contingent beings or things. God does not have the casual relationship with the universe that contingent successive things have with each other. God is not the last member in a long succession of contingent things or beings and not subject to scientific study that only applies to the relationships among members or components of the physical universe. Science relies on sense experience and examines relationships among the members of the physical universe. The concept of God as uncaused is outside this membership and transcend time. The argument that God must have a cause is a fallacious argument raised from the anthropomorphic perspective of a divine being subject of time. Anything subject to time would have a beginning. If something has a beginning, it has a cause. But a divine being outside of time and not considered part of the physical universe would have no beginning and no end.

It is the presence of God's Voice, the Holy Spirit, that knowledge of reality breaks through and points us to the way for happiness because God wills only for our happiness. Most of our time, unfortunately is spent in avoiding the presence of God by giving our attention to diversions and distractions that only assist us in evading the reality that provides an answer to the human predicament. Our involvement with diversions prevents us from seeing the real beauty and meaning of reality.

Since God calls us to return our minds to its proper function as co-creators, we do not need to rely on argument for God's existence. Knowledge of God is possible through conscious interaction with God. For so long as you insist on an identity that is separate from the wholeness of reality from God you will experience problems - you will do suffering to yourself, and you will take endless meaningless journeys to death's door. There is only one problem; and only one solution. Stop lingering in time and be not separate from the infinite and eternal One.

"School of THOUGHT: 7.10.2021
Imminent CATATROPHES!
Devil’s triangle doesn’t warn the passing ships of helicopters it is going to SWOLLOW them.
It is our common belief that we Humans are the most intellectually dominant beings, but not many of us admit the fact our intellectual limits are pertained to the laws of nature. And we are still yet to answer many questions that the nature poses in front of us as such:
1. What, or who is behind the interactive laws of CAUSE and Effect.
2. Why the former 20 odd human species were exterminated from the face of this planet over the course of history, beside uncountable and un-recorded other species?
3. Why is the current Covid 19 only infects the humans indiscriminately, but not any other animal species despite we all take essential precautions?
4. There is no evidence available to tell us how the former 20 odd human species were exterminated, but we do have archaeological evidence prove, the species before our race went extinct around 7, 2 million years ago, which coincides the occurrence of 2ndIce Age. And to my belief our ancestors developed from the DNAs of those Hominid species.
5. The thing that makes me laugh and think is, with all those unseen disasters nature punishing and warning us to come to our humane senses we are STUBBORNLY becoming more and more STUPID to maintain our ways of life -BUSINESS as USUAL type- as if those distinct warnings aren’t for us as if nothing is happening!
6. What is actually happening in real sense currently is human race is being exterminated in slow motion on daily basis. If we don’t see the eruption of another Ice Age to exterminate all living species, it is because the nature worked for billons of years to plan, design and develop those species, and she doesn’t want to punish the parties who had nothing to do with causing what is happening.
As I often repeat, ‘the aim of EVOLUTIONARY process is the PERFECTION of all species physically as well as intellectually.
The next human species, which in my view mother nature planning to develop, will be closer to the desired perfection. Unless the present world majority comes to their senses to perfect themselves before the imminent total extermination…
I won’t know what is happening in other parts of the world, but I’ve just spoken to my son on the phone who said, “life has stopped in Melbourne, and they can only travel to the local shops to buy their immediate needs.
The common saying of “Life is the survival for the” fittest” changing into, ‘living is for those who deserve it intellectually as well as physically’…
Would you consider those considerable world crowds deserve living comfortably in human society who believe an ancient Jewish man, who became dust and rubble over 2000 years ago will come alive and rescue them?
Those are the kind of people who are yet to learn, the BIGGEST cause of DEATH is the IGNORANCE’.

"World humanism part 14
This is the ORIGINAL ideology of federated world community -backed up by a powerful philosophy- to KILL the Zionist plans of Globalism, New world order and one world government. And this is the only political ideology to resolve the irreconcilable CLASS ANTAGONISM.
Our PRINCIPLE philosophy is; 'in order to change the society, you need to change the CULTURE of the society'.
cvi) Meanwhile: the Socialism within the frame work of Capitalism is nothing but a bunch of BUREAUCRATIC DICTATORSHIP... Unless the Socialism is a global socio economic system with planned world economy; it is just another OPPRESSIVE political system for the working masses; no matter what nation state applies it...
Which is evident in the cases of China, Cuba and all those socialist labelled -counterrevolutionary- 'Nationalist' regimes.
That shouldn't mean I agree with Karl Marx's Socialism projection; where the working class is 'dictator' over the society under the dictation of a bunch of Marxist PARASITIC minority bureaucrats; and where the Democratic principles lifted to the shelves...
In our Humanist socio economic system there is no dictatorial authority, and the high contributing individuals are rewarded by handsome incentives, instead of being fearful of dictations.
Social Evolution is ESSENTIAL to ACHIEVE the Social Revolution.
1. It is the course of social EVOLUTION. Which will proceed naturally and decided by the socio-economic DY-NAMICS.
2. But if you are SKEPTIC not to know the laws of CAUSE and EFFECT; there is no cure for you.
3. It is NOT an impossible dream. Just a matter of UNI-FICATION of the co-thinkers of the world around a VIA-BLE political perspective.
4. But remember the socio-political fact that the Revolutions are the end results of Social Evolution.
5. And it cannot be achieved through the struggles of disoriented minorities, but through the UNIFIED efforts of dissatisfied majorities.
6. Social Evolution is ESSEN-TIAL to ACHIEVE the Social Revolution.11
7. Also bear in mind; today's traditional LEFT forces,-Marxist Trotskyist crowds- consist of parasitic EDUCAT-ED IGNORANT.
8. The first aspect every class conscious and progressive person to understand is; the SOCIALSIM/HUMANISM is the ALTERNATIVE world system to the Capitalism. Not the Nationalist factions like China or Cuba -and the rest- within the Capitalist order.
9. The DIFFERENCE is control-ling the world Economic system; by the minority Rich, or democratically elected community councils...
10. Which is to say; the productive forces of the world governed by the democratically elected Workplace, Community and Student councils.
11. And there can be no National solution to resolve CLASS AN-TAGONISM>
12. Which is to say that the PROGRESSIVE forces of the world community have the greatest RESPONSIBILTY to train and educate their social contacts politically.
13. No more Jaguera style individual HEROISM.
14 No more BUREAUCRACY dictatorships over the workers’ class struggle around the world.
15. Noooo more ‘once a leader is always a leader’ business within the Humanist organizations.
16. Instead, every RESPONSIBLE class conscious minded person should do his/her best to find a SOLUTION for facilitating the communities to train one another politically…
17. As we have proposed in the perspective of the Humanist International: A leader or member of the Humanist organization can only stand One or Maximum of 2 terms in his/her political party post… In order to regularly dynamize the political structure and prevent opportunism as well as corruption…
18. If you are TRULY a GENUINE progressive REVOLUTIONARY minded person, join the RANKS of Humanist International by joining the progressive elements in your locality to start CULTURAL GROUP DISCUSSIONS....
19. Our Revolutionary Ideology is LEGITIIMISED by the fact that, we are defending the interests of greatest majority of the world community...
20. Remember: The present world affairs are in the hands of LUNATIC financial OLIGARCH; their cultural RETARD political servants and confused duck world scientists; who are taking advantage of theeeeee political IGNORANCE of the world masses...
21. The majority of the world's youth today regard ""the politics is dirty business for politicians”...
What a PITY though: LIFE isn't long enough to repeat STUPIDITIES'...
22. Especially in this epoch of MASS unemployment, unbearable POVERTY and the WAR THREATS the Capitalism is dragging the mankind to medieval slave trade conditions by conditioning us to the excessive poverty.... ... ...
23. The raw materials -class conscious youth and workers- of the Revolution are out there at every level of society. It's just that not many progressive forces are available to train and motivate them politically...
24. And that is for the simple reason that, the pre-sent generation is grown up during the Prospering years of Capitalism assimilated them to the middle-class ideology...",2850421515101743,https://facebook.com/groups/philosophyoftruth/posts/2850421515101743,2022-04-28 22:42:05

"I want to ask some people who are they? What are their real faces behind those virtue signaling masks? Who are you? No, really, who are you?

“I’m gay.”

No, I’m not asking you about your sexual preference. I don’t really care with whom you sleep with, share your bed with, drowning your body inside of sexual escapades. I’m asking you, who are you?

“I’m black.”

No, you don’t understand. I’m not asking you about your skin color. Skin color is just a skin color it doesn’t have individuality, it doesn’t have nothing but a shade, a hue that makes you adaptive to a certain climate. I’m asking what is inside of you. Behind that skin color of yours. What makes you, you? Who are you?

“I’m a transwoman and transwomen are women!”

No, they’re not and that’s why you call yourself a transwoman, isn’t it? That’s why you use trans in front of a woman, right? But anyway, what are you on the inside? What are your thoughts? Wishes? Dreams? Desires? Hopes? Who are you?

“You’re a transphobe!!!”

I’m not. I’m not afraid of transgender people. Stop calling me this. This word makes no sense because you overused it on the wrong people like an angry kid throwing rocks in every direction.

“Black Lives Matter!”

Are you sure you understand what you’re saying? This racially insensitive, corrupt organization doesn’t define you unless you’re on top of it with millions of dollars to your bank account and several mansions in Los Angeles. Who are you?

“I’m a progressive woman!”

I can see that and you’re quite attractive but something is wrong with your eyes, with your voice. Why are you screaming? Why are you so psychotic? So insecure? Who are you? What do you believe in? What gives your life meaning?

“MeToo! Believe All Women! Don’t Say Gay!”

You’re spitting these rotten slogans into my face while I’m breathing it all in trying to digest without going crazy. You’re smacking me with your artificiality while I’m trying to understand who you are in reality. Who are you? Really, honestly, behind those thousands of masks over your young and so attractive face?

“Don’t you dare to mansplain me with your white male privilege you racist!”

I don’t. I’m just wanting to understand you. But the more I try the more I see there’s nothing to understand behind those numerous trendy slogans, behind those numerous masks of fake modernity, embarrassing to commonsense TikTok videos. You are emptiness of overfilled ideology. You are perversive sexuality since there’s no true intimacy in your sexual experience, nor trust. You are fear because the ground under your feet is too unstable. You are full of insecurity and something more, something so alluding at first but pretty clear in the end. This something is ‘responsibility’ you utterly refuse to take for yourself and therefore hiding your real undeveloped angry self behind your gender, skin color, sexual preferences and trendy ideology of the day. There’s really no You. There’s really nothing much but foolishness and confusion…

"""To those who could hear it, the silence was deafening."" 🎈

AT some point between March and April 2021, Kader Konuk, Director of the world’s largest Turkish Studies institute outside of Turkey itself, quietly relinquished her title. There was no announcement from Konuk or her university. There was no statement—in protest, support, or otherwise—from any of the academic associations in which Konuk plays a leading role. There was not even a modification to Konuk’s duties as listed on her faculty web page, or to her online CV. Save for two tiny details—the web page now listed her as “Deputy Director” rather than “Director,”2 and the title of “Director” vanished from the footer of her e-mails—it seemed as if nothing had changed at all. To those who could hear it, the silence was deafening...

"Hello all,
The past few weeks, I have been going through a crisis of existence. I've kind of become convinced that there are a number or even (many) theories, what life could mean if it means anything at all.
Its partially about whether I'm the only one who perceives 'real' (solipsism). I have the idea that 'life' could possibly be a simulation, or just a dream of another 'being', existing only in my head or that of someone else. I notice that these thoughts give me a lot of anxiety, because this causes me to doubt whether my wife and children really exist? Is my love for them really 'real'?
In addition, I also have the idea that 'the' 'system' we live in is designed in such a way that it is impossible to prove what reality actually means. I have often read comments from people who say that solipsism can be debunked because the solipsist then has to know 'everything', he is omniscient. However, I see it differently, what if the 'reality' we live in is purposely arranged in such a way that you know very little, if you have questions, or if you do not understand certain things, then you are assuming that you are not alone because you need to get your information elsewhere. The same goes for comments I get on my posts, are they real? Or are they just there to make me believe there are others that aren't actually there?
People sometimes tell me, that they themselves are unique beings with their own identities and lives. However, that does not prove anything, because that is exactly what 'the' 'system' wants us to believe.
Then I have another question about the possibility of what is the real reality. You / me could come up with a countless number of theories about which reality really exists. With a small difference in detail in every reality, but still a theory of its own. If you then compare these innumerable theories against the theory that I currently 'live' as I have always believed it (the current world as it is now) then you have a chance of 1 against innumerable. This means that the chance is little to none that the world and the theory adopted by us or me is correct.
I have also been told that by grounding yourself, you can stay more present in the current reality, however, I can say the same here as above. (this too will simply be part of 'the' 'system'). Every experience, touch, thought, expression, etc. would then simply be part of 'the' 'system' to make it as 'real' as possible, or rather impossible to prove otherwise.
I would like to see your ideas and opinions about this, and/or how you would deal with this, possibly accepting the uncertainty?
Even the last sentence above feels to me like I'm asking 'the' 'system' a question that can only answer in a self-perpetuating way to make it as 'real' as possible.
Btw I need to note that I also have quite debilitating OCD, or at least that's what I think I have, that's what doctors have diagnosed me with. But what if having 'OCD' is just part of 'the' 'System' to make it more real?",2847386165405278,https://facebook.com/groups/philosophyoftruth/posts/2847386165405278,2022-04-25 06:44:11

"This morning I am absorbing ‘The 33 Strategies of War,’ And seeking solace in solitude. 1 concept is To wage war against self. In this sense the adage of ‘Keep your friends close...’ has no truer meaning than when it comes to self. In my experience, my most worthy, cunning, persistent, ruthless and handsome opponent has been myself. In fact, there have been times when I felt more comfortable amongst A group of foes than I was being alone. Ive built mental prisons for myself, and not a nice one like Pablo Escobar, but something worthy of the Inquisition. Well every problem has a solution. Consider a problem to be like a knot, the bigger the problem is perceived , the more elaborate the knot. A knot can be intentional, but more often Like weeds in a garden, from neglect-INERTIA. If I make a haphazard attempt ,the result as we know is more knots. So the only way to untangle knots is with Diligence and purpose and once we begin and gain confidence in our MOMENTUM, we realize that it was not a ‘Devils knot‘ after all, but a ‘tantrum knot’ of an upset toddler.

“We play through the hand, but by the mind. We live through the body, but It’s mind which is experiencing the whole life, being excited sometimes, sometimes being low.”
As socrates said, The unexamined life is not worth living. Philosophy is not just a necessity of the scholars sitting in big ivory towers giving lectures in classes.
Sartre wrote like a novelist.
Simone de Beauvoir too wrote fiction,
Kirkegaard,
For Nietzsche, all philosophy could even be redefined as a form of psychology, or history
With that, I conclude, one of the basic tenets of Existentialism. Philosophy is to be lived instead of conceptualised. Philosophy is just like the leg of human body, Lack of it paralyses a human to live a good meaningful life

"Good morning. Some here may be interested in this panel event to take place on Tuesday 17th May at 13.00. It will explore ethical understandings of the new technology of gene drives. Invasive insect species represent a significant threat to native animals, to ecological systems, to food security, and to human health in different countries around the world, especially in the Global South. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 editing technologies have opened the prospect of managing this threat in a new way by means of gene drives. But how should we think about this sort of technology? Are currently regulatory frameworks competent, or is this a biologically and conceptually novel ethical situation?

"World humanism part 9
This is the ORIGINAL ideology of federated world community -backed up by a powerful philosophy- to KILL the Zionist plans of Globalism, New world order and one world government. And this is the only political ideology to resolve the irreconcilable CLASS ANTAGONISM.
How are we going to reach up to that stage again?
“STARTING POINT: To make it easy for the working masses UNITE around ONE common Political perspective, Consistently propagate and organize the COUNCILS of WORKPLACES;(To replace the PARASITIC Union bureaucracy) even the councils of LOCALITIES and higher education institutes to politicize the housewives, unemployed, dynamic pensioners and the advanced sections of students –in the forms of associations is a ‘must’ to facilitate the effective political communication, in real revolutionary terms- and to form up ORGANISED world-wide revolutionary army against the dominant world Capitalism with the aim of to ABOLISHING this MAD and ENDANGERING profit system.
b) The objective basis or method of these revolutionary activities need to be ‘LEARN and TEACH procedure’ to spread the constructive political education around the communities up until the revolutionary consciousness spreading to the wider masses and the conditions become mature to take over the authority from the hands of Capitalists establishments.... ... (After declaring global GENERAL STRIKES at a specified date...)
c) These revolutionary movements can be initiated through the wonderful internet technology from homes to homes, from suburbs to suburbs, cities to cities, from schools to schools and countries to countries via sharing and exchanging ideas and information between the PROGRESSIVE individuals and groups internationally.
Just for the records girls and guys; the Marxist BUREAUCRATISM that started in the ranks of 2nd international -Social Democracy- passed to the Stalinist era for a prolonged period in such a way the International working class voluntarily joined and politically supported the ranks of this bureaucratic shell to protect the Stalin dominated Soviet Union. It was a COMMON belief that the SSR was the LOCOMATIVE of the world socialist revolution.
Then in 1938 Leon Trotsky called the foundation of the 4th International amid DEGENERATION and betrayals of the 3rd Communist international.
However the same BUREAUCRATIC tradition passed to the ranks of this latest international without upgrading a damn thing, which still goes on within the ranks of 4th international today...
Throughout its 80 odd years of history, this, so called world party of socialist revolution, became a breeding ground of bureaucratic minded political parasites, who made their livings from the pockets of working class without contributing anything constructive to the revolutionary class struggle.
If you are; by any chance, following their publications in the social media now-days; you will notice the reality that, they have become a totally anti-capitalist, or left wing news organ, who have nothing what so ever to do with being revolutionary party…
In our proposed revolutionary class struggle, the primary KEY factor is the group discussions at every conceivable locality of the nations without exposing ourselves to the security elements of the system.
The other sheer FACT, is; it is NOT that important what you KNOW. What COUNTS is, what you DO with what you know…
How do we figure out the differences between the RIGHT and WRONG again guys and girls?
In my view there is only one way to do it, and that is the logical REASONING in every form of human; social or political relation. But let’s not forget the fact that; once you disregard the IMPORTANCE of that ‘logical reasoning’; you are also disregarding the laws of CAUSE and IMPACT. In which case you will get TRAPPED in the ironical PARADOX…
As we mentioned a couple of times before: If every parliamentary legislation was generated on the basis of LOGICAL REASONING and supported by public REFERANDUMS; we would minimize the social contradictions in the society to the limits…
Then again: How can you expect a constructive REASONING from a pervert system, in which the bloody democratically ILLOGIC starts with the appointments of those political contractors?
In our humanist system the political candidates will be nominated from the bottom sections of the COMMUNITIES –each local community selecting and nominating their own representatives- instead of being selected by the elites of the society from the TOP and imposed on the public to vote for them promoted via capitalist press and media- society to be voted for…
What is the free choice given to you and me in this system of CORRUPTION and DECEPTION?
Vote for the options of the A, B, or C… What else?

"Tolstoy would turn in his grave at the thought
In life, two people can't agree on a common opinion on anything, let alone create together. And in the experiment described in the article, it shows how to change and acquire new qualities and like-minded people.
TOLSTOY WOULD TURN IN HIS GRAVE AT THE THOUGHT
Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This is how Lev Tolstoy put it. AMEN! Who could argue with that?
However, if we were to paraphrase this statement, taking away the excess wording, a deeper, more significant thought is revealed. People are happy similarly but unhappy in their own way. It is practically the Darwinism that Tolstoy so loathed. The great writer would turn in his grave if he read this. Here is why.
Let us recall the intellectually-refreshing experiment (1957) conducted by the evolutionary biologist Georgy Shaposhnikov. The experiment consisted of the following: Shaposhnikov undertook an experiment on plant lice, aphids. Aphids are monophage, which means that they feed on one type of host plant only. Some aphids feed on one species of plant, others aphids will feed on a different species. Groups with different host plants are incapable of crossbreeding and, therefore, are considered separate species. Aphids will die if they are transplanted onto an unfamiliar host plant – all 100%. What did Shaposhnikov do? He transferred aphids onto an unsuitable plant and, when the aphids were reaching the point of death, he transferred them back to their original host plant for the period of one day. After the aphids were revived and had eaten their fill, Shaposhnikov transferred the revived aphids back to the other plant, at which point, an amazing thing became clear. Yes, 95% of the aphids died but the other 5% survived. Moreover, they had learned to feed on an unsuitable host plant, that is, they had transformed to such an extent, that they could no longer interbreed with the parent species.
The most interesting thing about this experiment is that not just one individual transformed, a fact that could be explained as random mutation, but quite a number of individuals transformed simultaneously, that very same 5%. It became clear that speciation is the result of the determined effort of an evolving group. Will power is the means to achieve a goal. In the case of the plant lice in Shaposhnikov’s experiment, many were of the opinion that the goal was simply to eat enough to stay alive. Or could there have been something more significant at play? Either way, the goal was collective. Synchronized.
So, will, not random mutation. Moreover synchronized will of at least 144 individuals. The fact is that the mutation of one organism is useless. Since, post mutation, an individual cannot reproduce even from its parent species, a single mutated individual will inevitably die. No question. Even a dozen mutated individuals are insufficient to ensure procreation. Consanguineous “marriages” occur, but all offspring degrade and also perish. The minimum number of individuals essential to procreate thereby avoiding extinction, has long been established –144 individuals. More than this, procreation is still possible, less than this number – no chance.
Synchronizing enough to ensure collective mutation is not an easy task. All members of the evolving group must agree on certain key concepts, above all, on the matter of death. It is a paradox: if you want to live, first get straight with death, and therein find the Truth. At least in this matter.",676873806697185,https://facebook.com/groups/241625830221987/posts/676873806697185,2022-03-15 09:58:45

"Are Putin and Selesky innocent or ignorant? really they both are Innocent in front of the war. Putin and Selesky created the shortest war in world human history, and 99% of the world population rejected it. As… More well as it will be the last war in our natural planet. Certainly, the war and war arms will soon disappear from our natural planet, and it has been proved by the shortest war between Russia and Ukraine. Now, they both should need to begin to save the planet and the nature who created them.

"Who started the war between Russia and Ukraine? Putin and Zelensky did not cause the war. But, the wrong teaching and wrong theories of world socialization and social process about the earth, nature, man and knowledge created a war in Russia and Ukraine. The global man must believe in naturalization and must defeat the global false socialization in the world. Until then, all the people of the world are creators and contributors of the wars and the war arms.",673664393684793,https://facebook.com/groups/241625830221987/posts/673664393684793,2022-03-09 21:19:09

"Relativity implies that this/our reality is eternal. Einstein proved to us that there is no time. If this truly is an eternal object, a multiverse, then you cannot die and are also eternal, because of the Boltzman Brain, you're mind will amass itself again in another spot/timeline/instance and you will exist as soon as you die. There is no permeance to conciousness...

"WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT

It’s a fact – life comes into existence, lives for a period of time, and then goes out of existence. You and I had no choice about being born, and we have no choice about eventually ceasing to exist. All life forms have one fundamental goal – to remain alive. And to remain alive requires action – action to acquire those things which will sustain life. Those things are values. A plant’s values include water and minerals, and it acts to acquire these values or it dies. All life forms must acquire values, or cease to exist. Different life forms have different abilities that enable them to acquire values. The cheetah has the ability to run fast; almost all birds have the ability to fly. And man – man has the ability to think.
In order to think, one must have something to think about – one cannot think about nothing. That something to think about is reality. We do not live in a void; we live on earth in the real world. In order to survive, we must get a grip on reality. It is our senses that provide us with the raw data. Our ability to think allows us to integrate that data, draw logical conclusions, resolve contradictions – to reason. And reason tells us that we must act in order to survive – act to create and maintain those values that support man’s life on earth.

"What ACTUALLY is Temperature? - A Statistical Definition
Hi all, as part of a Thermodynamics series I covered temperature. We all have an intuitive idea of what temperature is but in this video I cover the rigorous physical concept of Temperature in statistical mechanics by looking at microstates and macrostates. P.s. it gets a bit maths-y
